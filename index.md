A workshop to showcase work using the Lean proof assistant.

Virtually via Zoom: 4â€”8 Jan 2021

## Description

Lean Together is an annual meeting for users, developers, and fans of the
[Lean proof assistant](https://leanprover.github.io)
and its library [mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io).
At this meeting we discuss ongoing projects in formalized mathematics and software verification,
as well as infrastructure and outreach for Lean and its community.

This year, due to world events, the meeting will be virtual.
The event is open to everyone without cost: feel free to attend as many sessions as you'd like.
We welcome and encourage speakers and participants from other proof assistant communities,
as well as people who are inexperienced with proof assistants but want to learn more.

## Format

The meeting will be held via Zoom, in a number of sessions spread out over the week of January 4.
We will vary the starting times of the sessions to accommodate people in different time zones.

We will have a mix of shorter talks about work in progress,
longer talks about more mature projects,
and some open discussion/planning sessions.

More detailed scheduling information will appear in the following weeks.

With the speakers' permission, talks will be recorded and posted to the
[leanprover community YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWe5B7Ikr0AI9727doEUxPg).

## Contributed talks

We would love to see casual work in progress talks from any and everybody who has WIP to share.
Anything formalization-related is in scope.
In particular, we do not require talks to involve Lean.
A big point of these workshops is
to get an idea of what other formalizers around the world are working on
and to coordinate efforts.
We're not only looking for polished conference talks,
and we'd like to leave plenty of time for discussion.

Would you/your team/your research group possibly be interested in presenting something?
Please let the organizers know, with no commitment!
