# Lean Together 2021

A virtual workshop to showcase work using the Lean proof assistant — [4—8 Jan 2021]

## Description

This is a follow-up workshop to
[Lean Together 2019](https://lean-forward.github.io/lean-together/2019/) and
[Formal Methods in Mathematics / Lean Together 2020](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/avigad/meetings/fomm2020/).
More info soon!

## Contributed talks

We would love to see casual work in progress talks from any and everybody who has WIP to share.
Anything formalization-related is in scope.
A big point of these workshops is
to get an idea of what other formalizers around the world are working on
and to coordinate efforts.
We're not only looking for polished conference talks,
and we'd like to leave plenty of time for discussion.

Would you/your team/your research group possibly be interested in presenting something?
Please let the organizers know, with no commitment!

## Organization

Main organization by:
[Robert Y. Lewis](https://robertylewis.com) and
[Patrick Massot](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~pmassot/en/).
